to get latest dependencies check out "https://tamsenior.visualstudio.com/_git/dependencies" from inside this directory
you will also need to copy the necesary dlls to the debug/release folder, i created a powershell script to handle this for you 
just run '$ powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -File CopyDebugDlls.ps1' from commandline

so just to sum up:
1. run: '$git clone https://tamsenior.visualstudio.com/_git/dependencies' from inside this directory
2. run: '$ powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -File CopyDebugDlls.ps1' also inside this directory
